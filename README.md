###User Authentication
The demo currently integrates basic authentication with Kinvey and shows how one could implement Models & Services in an AngularJS way within the application

###Models & Services

For this example, we are using the concept of an Avatar/File as the model so we create a Model object and a Service to manipulate instances of the Model objects. In this scenario we are implementing file upload and file retrieval of the object datastore in Kinvey.
